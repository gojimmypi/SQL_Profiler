"# SQL_Profiler" 

This utility is essentially the same as the SQL Profiler app, however instead of a GUI all data is recorded to a table.

Typical useage is for security monitoring and logging of all SQL activity.

The default server is localhost, and database is sql_profile_log.

See docs folder for SQL script to create a couple of tables.

For SQL I/O see Microsoft.ApplicationBlocks.Data; (https://github.com/gojimmypi/PatternsAndPractices)
